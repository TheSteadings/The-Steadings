        <div class="contentText">
          <p>The Steadings at Townhead Farm Houghton is a family run business steeped in history. From the main Georgian farmhouse circa 1700 to the barn conversions surrounding it, each building is named for its origin from when we were a working farm.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Hayloft, The Granary, and The Dovecote are spacious conversions designed with your comfort in mind and on a self-catering basis. For guests preferring ground floor accommodation we have two purposely built two-bedroom properties which open from French doors onto spacious grounds.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Granary is our designated pet-friendly property, enabling your much-loved pet to accompany you on holiday.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We are able to offer both one-night stays/weekend breaks and longer stays tailored to suit your needs, and we have lots of parking available for large and small vehicles. In addition, we have a hairdressers, beauty salon, and laundrette on-site. We also cater for relocations and businesses.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We are friendly and caring, and offer all of our guests a warm welcome on their arrival at The Steadings.</p>
